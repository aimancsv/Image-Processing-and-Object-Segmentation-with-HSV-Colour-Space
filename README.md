# Image-Processing-and-Object-Segmentation-with-HSV-Colour-Space
This project demonstrates image segmentation using the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) colour space for object detection. The primary goal of this project was to explore the effectiveness of HSV in segmenting images based on colour and evaluating its performance in various real-world test cases.

## Objective
- To understand the concept of colour spaces in image processing.
- To implement object detection based on colour using the HSV colour space.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of HSV for image segmentation through various test cases.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**: A computer vision library used for reading, displaying images, converting between colour spaces, and applying image operations.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations, used to manipulate pixel values and colour ranges in HSV.

## Features
- Segmenting objects in images based on their colours (Red, Blue, Yellow).
- Handling varying lighting conditions and noisy images.
- Demonstrating the robustness of HSV in image segmentation compared to other colour spaces like RGB.


### Testing

The project includes various test cases to evaluate the algorithm, such as:
