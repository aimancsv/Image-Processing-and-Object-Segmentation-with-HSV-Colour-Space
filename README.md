# Image-Processing-and-Object-Segmentation-with-HSV-Colour-Space
This project demonstrates image segmentation using the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) colour space for object detection. The primary goal of this project was to explore the effectiveness of HSV in segmenting images based on colour and evaluating its performance in various real-world test cases.
